# [BuilderOnCity](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3308223701)
This is a mod I made to make Civ6 easier for me. It was often hard to get a city up and running, so I made this mod instead of getting better.
It just makes a builder spawn when you make a city. It does glitch, that when you load a game it seems to spawn builders again. I do not plan on updating this mod again.
